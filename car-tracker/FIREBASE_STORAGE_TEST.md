# Firebase Configuration Test

## Quick Firebase Storage Test

To verify your Firebase Storage is configured correctly, you can run this simple test in your browser console:

1. **Open your app in the browser** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Log in to your account**
3. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
4. **Go to the Console tab**
5. **Paste and run this code**:

```javascript
// Test Firebase Storage Configuration
async function testFirebaseStorage() {
    console.log('🧪 Testing Firebase Storage...');
    
    // Check if Firebase Storage is available
    try {
        const { storage } = await import('./services/firebase.js');
        console.log('✅ Firebase Storage imported successfully');
        
        // Check if user is authenticated
        const { useAuth } = await import('./context/AuthContext.js');
        console.log('✅ Auth context available');
        
        // Test storage reference creation
        const { ref } = await import('firebase/storage');
        const testRef = ref(storage, 'test-path');
        console.log('✅ Storage reference created successfully');
        
        console.log('🎉 Firebase Storage appears to be configured correctly!');
        console.log('📝 Now try uploading a profile picture.');
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ Firebase Storage test failed:', error);
    }
}

testFirebaseStorage();
```

## Expected Results:

If everything is configured correctly, you should see:
```
🧪 Testing Firebase Storage...
✅ Firebase Storage imported successfully
✅ Auth context available
✅ Storage reference created successfully
🎉 Firebase Storage appears to be configured correctly!
📝 Now try uploading a profile picture.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### 1. **CORS Error** (Current Issue)
- **Cause**: Firebase Storage rules not configured
- **Solution**: Follow the FIREBASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md instructions to set up proper Storage rules

### 2. **Authentication Error**
- **Cause**: User not logged in or auth token expired
- **Solution**: Log out and log back in

### 3. **Permission Denied**
- **Cause**: Storage rules too restrictive
- **Solution**: Update Storage rules to allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder

### 4. **File Size Error**
- **Cause**: File too large (over 5MB)
- **Solution**: Use a smaller image file

## Manual Firebase Console Check:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: leaguesubstitute-d1bbf
3. **Go to Storage**: Click "Storage" in left sidebar
4. **Check Rules**: Click "Rules" tab and verify they match the ones in FIREBASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md
5. **Check Usage**: Make sure you haven't exceeded storage limits

## Next Steps:

1. **Set up Storage Rules** (most important - see FIREBASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md)
2. **Test the profile picture upload** after rules are applied
3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Verify the image appears** in both the profile page and navigation bar

After following the storage setup guide, your profile picture upload should work correctly!
